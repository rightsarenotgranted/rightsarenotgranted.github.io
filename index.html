        <p>"The alleged right to rule, in any degree and in any form, is the opposite of humanity. The initiation of violence is the opposite of harmonious coexistence. The desire for dominion is the opposite of love for mankind. Hiding the violence under layers of complex rituals and self-contradictory rationalizations, and labeling brute thuggery as virtue and compassion, does not change that fact. Claiming noble goals, saying that the violence is “the will of the people,” or that it is being committed “for the common good” or “for the children,” cannot change evil into good. “Legalizing” wrong does not make it right. One man forcibly subjugating another, no matter how it is described or how it is carried out, is uncivilized and immoral. The destruction it causes, the injustice it creates, the damage it does to every soul that it touches – perpetrators, victims, and spectators alike – cannot be undone by calling it “law,” or by claiming that it was necessary. Evil, by any name, is still evil."</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"Rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will, within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law,' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the right of an individual."</p>
            <cite>–Thomas Jefferson</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Rights are not granted. Rights are not based on laws. Rights are inherent, meaning they exist within us, and cannot be taken away. We are born with them, and we will die with them. The extent of your own rights is only bound by the rights of another. If an action does not bring harm to, and does not involve the property of another being, then it is within your rights to take that action.</p>
          <p>Any other action without the prior consent of those involved is outside of your rights and you have no right to take it. If prior consent is granted, then this action now becomes a privilege. Privileges can be revoked at any time for any reason.</p>

          <p>Violence is the <em>initiation</em> of force against another being in violation of their inherent rights. Violence can never be justified.</p>
          <p>Defensive Force on the other hand, is force used in <i>response</i> to an act of violence. Once an act of violence is initiated, other beings have the right to defend themselves, or those being accosted, with whatever level of force necessary to stop the violence from continuing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Those who crave dominion gain much more power by convincing their victims that it is wrong to disobey their commands than by convincing their victims that it is merely dangerous (but moral) to disobey. No matter how much the people complain and protest, as long as the people continue to obey “the law” (the commands of politicians), the tyrants have little to fear. As long as their attempts to control and extort are seen as “legal” acts of “authority,” and as long as the people therefore feel an obligation to comply, unless and until the ruling class changes such “laws,” the people will remain enslaved in body, because they remain mentally enslaved."</p>
            <cite>–Larken Rose</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Authority, according to the New Oxford American Dictionary, is defined as follows:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <ul>
              <li>The power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience.</li>
              <li>The right to act in a specified way, delegated from one person or organization to another.</li>
              <li>Official permission; sanction.</li>
            </ul>
          </blockquote>
          <p>If no individual has the right to give orders and enforce obedience upon others who are not infringing upon another's rights, where does this power or “right” come from? How can a “right,” such as the right to declare and enforce arbitrary laws, be delegated if no individual possesses the right to begin with? The answer is it cannot. No amount of legislative magic or ritual can change this simple fact. Any claim of authority over another being that violates their rights is unquestionably false and illusory.</p>
          <p>No Man is above another, and no Man possesses rights that every other Man does not also possess.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress them at once?"</p>
            <cite>–Henry David Thoreau</cite>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"The purest invitation to tyranny is your commitment to obey law regardless of what it says."</p>
            <cite>–Jeremy Locke</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Obedience is not a virtue. Following orders does not absolve you of responsibility. A true moral being is someone who exercises conscience, meaning they recognize the objective difference between right and wrong and willfully choose the right, regardless of the consequences. Free will enables this choice. No matter the circumstance, the choice exists.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Freedom and Morality are directly proportional... The more moral a population is, the freer it becomes, the more immoral a population is, the deeper into bondage and slavery it goes."</p>
            <cite>–Mark Passio</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Freedom will be born into this world once enough people realize that they alone are responsible for their actions and willfully choose to take a stand for what is right.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."</p>
            <cite>–Second Amendment (U.S. Constitution)</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Guard with jealous attention the public liberty. Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel. Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that force, you are inevitably ruined."</p>
            <cite>–Patrick Henry</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Second Amendment, along with the other Amendments included in the Bill of Rights, do not grant rights. The Bill of Rights was put into place to explicitly restrict the government from infringing on people's inherent rights. It can be seen clearly in the language with phrases such as:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Congress shall make no law..."<br/>
            "...the right of the people... shall not be infringed..."<br/>
            "The right of the people... shall not be violated..."
          </blockquote>
          <p>Nowhere does it claim to be granting any rights. This is further borne out in the text of the Ninth Amendment:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The rights of the people exist, the Bill of Rights was an attempt to protect them.</p>
          <p>The Second Amendment asserts the necessity of a well armed, well trained populace for the preservation of Freedom. Again, this is not granting the right to keep and bear arms, the right to defend oneself, by any means necessary, is inherent. Arms act as an equalizer, and a well armed, well trained populace is almost impossible to overtly dominate.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing."</p>
            <cite>–Adolph Hitler</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The spirit of gun ownership is still alive and well in the United States, being one of the main reasons there is still <i>any</i> semblance of Freedom remaining. Whether those Arms will be utilized in the Spirit of Liberty remains to be seen.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom – go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or your arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."</p>
